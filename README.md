# Task 2: Develop Time Series Forecasting Models  

## Overview  
This task involves building a **time series forecasting model** to predict **Tesla's future stock prices**. The objective is to analyze historical stock prices and develop a model that can accurately forecast future trends.  

## Models to Consider  
You can choose between **classical statistical models** and **deep learning models**:  

1. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**  
   - Suitable for univariate time series with **no seasonality**.  
2. **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**  
   - Extends ARIMA to **handle seasonality** in the data.  
3. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
   - A type of **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** that captures long-term dependencies in time series data.  

## Steps  

### 1. Data Preparation  
- Load historical Tesla stock price data.  
- Convert timestamps into a proper date-time format.  
- Handle missing values and outliers if necessary.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends, seasonality, and patterns.  

### 2. Splitting Dataset  
- **Training Set**: Used to train the model.  
- **Test Set**: Used to evaluate model performance.  

### 3. Model Training  
- Choose a forecasting model (**ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM**).  
- Train the model using the training set.  
- Tune hyperparameters using techniques like **Grid Search** or **auto_arima** (for ARIMA models).  

### 4. Forecasting and Evaluation  
- Use the trained model to **forecast future stock prices**.  
- Compare predictions with the **actual test data**.  
- Evaluate model performance using these metrics:  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
  - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**  

### 5. Model Optimization  
- Fine-tune model parameters to improve accuracy.  
- Experiment with different values of (p, d, q) for ARIMA/SARIMA.  
- For LSTM, adjust the **number of layers, neurons, and learning rate**.  

## Tools & Libraries  
- **pandas** (Data Handling)  
- **numpy** (Numerical Computations)  
- **matplotlib / seaborn** (Visualization)  
- **statsmodels** (ARIMA, SARIMA)  
- **pmdarima** (auto_arima for parameter tuning)  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (For LSTM models)  

## Expected Output  
- A trained **time series forecasting model** for Tesla stock prices.  
- Forecasted stock prices for the next period.  
- Performance evaluation report with **MAE, RMSE, and MAPE** scores.  

## Next Steps  
- Compare different models to determine the best-performing one.  
- Extend the project by incorporating external factors like **market sentiment, news analysis, or trading volume** for improved predictions.
